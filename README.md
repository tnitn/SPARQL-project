# SPARQL-project

## Introduction
The aim of this project is to compare the efficiency of TüNDRA (.conllu) and SPARQL (.ttl) query languages for retrieving data from linguistic treebanks.

### Material
The same databank *name* was used to illustrate the difference in queries. The .conllu treebank was accessed directly via [Tündra web tool.](https://weblicht.sfs.uni-tuebingen.de/Tundra/) The .ttl treebank was first downloaded from the [Universal Dependencies website](https://universaldependencies.org/) in the .conllu format, and then transformed into .ttl format with the help of [ConLL-RDF tool.*](https://github.com/acoli-repo/conll-rdf) Some further changes were then made to the .ttl file which will be further described in the Description section.
